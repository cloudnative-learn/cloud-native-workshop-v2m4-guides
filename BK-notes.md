# Bulent's notes

## Installation
Python does not rely on MacOS' openSSL. It comes with its own openSSL bundled and doesn't have access on MacOS' root certificates.

```
cd /Applications/Python\ 3.9/
./Install\ Certificates.command
```

```
ansible-galaxy install siamaksade.openshift_workshopper
```
